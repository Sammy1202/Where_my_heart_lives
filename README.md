# Still, It’s You ❤️

This repository holds something very special.

It’s not just code.
It’s not just a website.

It’s a small corner of the internet that exists because of you and for you, from me.

I made this to celebrate your birthday,
but also to hold our memories,
our milestones,
our quiet moments,
and all the love I sometimes don’t know how to put into words.

If you’re reading this,
it means I chose to show you something deeply personal.
I've started working on this since March 14th the day after you said yes and I'm hoping this lasts longer that one day I'll be showing our kids what it is to love someone and hold onto to them even when the whole world is against. 
I hope the day you see this you'll be proud of me and how far we've come rather than with tears in our eyes knowing this might be the end.
One day if we're far from eachother know that you'll live forever through me by this website. 

Every update here,
every photo,
every note,
is my way of choosing you —
again and again.

This space will grow,
just like us.

Always,
🤍
