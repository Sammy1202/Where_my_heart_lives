# Still, It’s You ❤️

This repository holds something very special.

It’s not just code.
It’s not just a website.

It’s a small corner of the internet that exists because of you.

I made this to celebrate your birthday,
but also to hold our memories,
our milestones,
our quiet moments,
and all the love I sometimes don’t know how to put into words.

If you’re reading this,
it means I chose to show you something deeply personal.

Every update here,
every photo,
every note,
is my way of choosing you —
again and again.

This space will grow,
just like us.

Always,
🤍
